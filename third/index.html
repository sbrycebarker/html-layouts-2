        <h2>Type Something</h2>
      Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic
books published by Marvel Comics, as well as its associated media. The character
was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber,
and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He made his first appearance in
Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).
  An American billionaire playboy, business magnate, and ingenious engineer,
Tony Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his
captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead
creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later,
Stark augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed
through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions
to protect the world as Iron Man, while at first concealing his true identity.
Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes,
particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against
communism.[1] Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from
Cold War themes to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.
[1] Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a
founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in
several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been
adapted for several animated TV shows and films. The character is portrayed by
Robert Downey Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical
and box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance,
reprised the role in a cameo in The Incredible Hulk (2008), two Iron Man
sequels Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013), The Avengers (2012) and
Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and will do so again in Captain America: Civil
War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and both parts of Avengers: Infinity
War (2018/2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man was ranked 12th on
IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011,[2] and third in their list of
"The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.[3]

                <p>  I think I gave myself a dare. It was the height of the Cold War. The
      readers, the young readers, if there was one thing they hated, it was war,
      it was the military....So I got a hero who represented that to the
      hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons
      for the Army, he was rich, he was an industrialist....I thought it would
      be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of our
      readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like
      him....And he became very popular.[7]</p>
