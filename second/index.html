      <article>Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American
        comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created
        by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger,[5][6] and first
        appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Originally named
        "the Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets
        as the "Caped Crusader", the "Dark Knight", and the "World's
        Greatest Detective".[7] Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne,
        an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of
        Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents as
        a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense
        of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and
        crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.[8] Batman operates in
        the fictional Gotham City, with assistance from various supporting
        characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim
        Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes,
        Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his
        genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective
        skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and
        indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues
        gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.

        Batman became popular soon after his introduction and gained his own
        comic book title, Batman, in 1940. As the decades went on, differing
        nterpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman
        television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be
        associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various
        creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating
        in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success of
        Warner Bros.' live-action Batman feature films have helped maintain
        public interest in the character.[9]
